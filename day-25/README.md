# Day 25

https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/25

I used the `AsciiInputOutput` from [day 21](../day-21) for the provided `Intcode` program,
and played the game by hand. After several retries, these are the necessary items to
make the droid weigh the desired amount:

- space heater
- antenna
- spool of cat6
- klein bottle
