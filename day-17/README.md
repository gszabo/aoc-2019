# Day 17

For part 1 I converted the output map to a character matrix (ie. list of strings),
checked for intersections and calculated the answer.

For part 2 I printed the [textual output to screen](./image.txt) and charted the path of the robot by hand (see
[steps.txt](./steps.txt)). Then I shortened the path with a text editor's search and replace function.
